# Attendance-using-Face-recognition

## Project description
The practice of attendance forgery has become very common due to the ongoing
pandemic. Despite of the efforts made by several educational institutions; this
practice persists. The conventional way of registering attendance that is roll call
is time consuming due to the increasing size of batches, therefore several
alternatives such as attendance via online forms is preferred. But even this is
easy to be deceived as it does not require the presence of the respective person
and hence anyone can fill the form thus faking the attendance.
Therefore, facial recognition comes into the picture. Along with being hassle
free, it fights forgery as it requires the physical presence of the respective
person. The algorithm could be run at certain time intervals forcing the student
to be present at all the times.

## Objective
The main purpose of this project is to minimize attendance forgery using facial
recognition.

## Problem statement
Earlier the attendance could be easy forged due to the vast use of online forms.
As a result of this problem a new system was developed, Attendance using
facial recognition.


## Python modules
-> Cv2 - Used for reading images from directory and webcam.<br/>
->NumPy - For implementing arrays in python.<br/>
->Face_recognition - For implementing face recognition functions.<br/>
->OS - For maintaining a list of the names of the images in the directory so as to read them using cv2 functions.<br/>
->Datetime For registering the attendance along with date and time.<br/>
